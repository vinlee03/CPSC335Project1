# CPSC335Project1
This is the repository containing the source code, project reports and readme files required for our group Algorithm Engineering Project 1

Our source code is written in Javascript


Group Contributions:

Vincent Lee: Created Github Repository, merged files, created psuedocode, and proved efficiency for Algorithm 1 report. Helped with proving efficiency for Algorithm 2. Assisted in writing comments and testing source code for Algorithm 1,2 and 3

Gustavo Necocha: 
Wrote Source code and comments for algorithm 2 and 3. Worked together with Andrew Arsenault to write source code for algorithm 1. Assisted with proving efficiency and writing psuedocode for algorithm 3.

Andrew Arsenault:
Helped write Algorithm 1 source code with Gustavo. Wrote Algorithm 3 project report by creating the psuedocode for Algorithm 3 and proved the efficiency of algorithm 3 using step count method. Assisted with proving efficiency for algorithm 2 using step count method.

Emmett Lim: Wrote the Psuedocode for algorithm 2. Helped prove the efficiency class of algorithm 2. Assisted with merging branch files into main github repository. Assited with writing psuedocode for algorithm 1. Assisted with understanding logic behind Algorithm 1.
